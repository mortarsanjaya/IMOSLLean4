\subsection*{Problem}

Let $f : \Z \to \Z$ be the function defined by
\[ f(n) = n \lfloor n/2 \rfloor \quad \text{for all } n \in \Z. \]
Find all integers $M$ such that $f^k(M)$ is even for some $k \geq 0$.



\subsection*{Answer}

Such $k$ exists if and only if $M \neq 3$.



\subsection*{Solution}

Official solution: \url{http://www.imo-official.org/problems/IMO2015SL.pdf}

We modify Solution 2 of the official solution for the above version of the problem.
We will prove the contrapositive; $f^k(M)$ is odd for all $k \geq 0$ if and only if $M = 3$.
The right-to-left direction is obvious since $f(3) = 3$.

For the other direction, it suffices to show that $2^{x + 1} \mid f^k(M) - 3$ for any $k, x \geq 0$.
We proceed by induction on $x$; the base case $x = 0$ is an implication of the initial hypothesis.
On the other hand, the induction step follows from the following claim.

\begin{claim}
Let $c$ and $m$ be integers such that $2c$ divides both $m - 3$ and $f(m) - 3$.
Then $4c$ divides $m - 3$.
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
We are done if $c = 0$, so now suppose that $c \neq 0$.
Write $m = 2cd + 3$ for some integer $d$.
Then $f(m) = (2cd + 3)(cd + 1)$.
Since $2c \mid f(m) - 3$, this implies $2c \mid 3cd$.
Then $d$ must be even, and thus $m - 3 = 2cd$ is divisible by $4c$, as desired.
\end{proof}
