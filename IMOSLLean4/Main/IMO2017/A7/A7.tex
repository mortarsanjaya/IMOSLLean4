Let $(b_n)_{n \geq 0}$ be a sequence of positive integers.
Let $(a_n)_{n \geq 0}$ be a sequence of integers defined by
\[ a_0 = 0, \quad a_1 = 1, \quad a_{n + 2} = \begin{cases} a_{n + 1} b_{n + 1} + a_n, & \text{if } b_n = 1, \\ a_{n + 1} b_{n + 1} - a_n, & \text{if } b_n > 1. \end{cases} \]
Prove that $\max\{a_n, a_{n + 1}\} \geq n$ for any $n \geq 0$.

There is a slight typo in proving $a_{n + 2} \geq n + 1$ for the case $b_n = 1$.
We just rewrite the referred solution here with a slight change.
For each $n \geq 0$, we let
\[ S_n = \sum_{k = 0}^{n - 1} a_k |b_k - 2|. \]

The main equality to be proved is $a_{n + 1} = a_n (b_n - 1) + S_n + 1$.
We proceed by induction on $n$.
The base case $n = 0$ is trivial.
For the induction step, set $c = 1$ if $b_n = 1$ and $c = -1$ if $b_n > 1$.
Then $a_{n + 1} = a_n (b_n - 1) + S_n + 1$ implies
\[ a_{n + 2} = a_{n + 1} b_{n + 1} + a_n c_n = a_{n + 1} (b_{n + 1} - 1) + a_n (b_n + c - 1) + S_n + 1. \]
But $b_n + c - 1 = |b_n - 2|$ by direct checking.
So indeed $a_{n + 2} = a_{n + 1} (b_{n + 1} - 1) + S_{n + 1} + 1$.
Induction step is complete.

Now, by induction on $n$, one can simultaneously prove that $a_n, S_n \geq 0$ for all $n \geq 0$.
From this, for any $n \geq 0$, we have
\[ a_{n + 1} + S_{n + 1} = a_n (b_n - 1 + |b_n - 2|) + 2 S_n + 1 \geq a_n + S_n + 1. \]
Since $a_0 + S_0 = 0$, we get $a_n + S_n \geq n$ for all $n$ by induction.
Finally, we show that $\max\{a_n, a_{n + 1}\} \geq n$ for any $n \geq 0$.
The case $n = 0$ is clear, so now replace $n$ with $n + 1$.
That is, we prove that for any $n \geq 0$, either $a_{n + 1} \geq n + 1$ or $a_{n + 2} \geq n + 1$ holds.
The former holds if $b_n > 1$ and the latter holds if $b_n = 1$:
\[ b_n > 1 \implies a_{n + 1} = a_n (b_n - 1) + S_n + 1 \geq a_n + S_n + 1 \geq n + 1; \]
\[ b_n = 1 \implies a_{n + 2} \geq S_{n + 1} + 1 = a_n + S_n + 1 \geq n + 1. \]
