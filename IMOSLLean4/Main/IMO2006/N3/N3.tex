The solution presented below is a copy of the official solution with some parts of the solution being cut off.

For each positive integer $n$, let $d(n)$ denote the number of divisors of $n$, and denote $g(n) = n f(n)$.
Also, let $g(n) = n f(n)$.
First of all, it can be shown by induction on $n$ that
\[ g(n) = \sum_{k = 1}^n \left\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \right\rfloor = \sum_{k = 1}^n d(k). \]
In particular, we have $g(n + 1) = g(n) + d(n + 1)$ for any $n \geq 1$.

\begin{enumerate}

\item
Notice that $f(n + 1) > f(n) \iff d(n + 1) > f(n) \iff n d(n + 1) > g(n)$.
This immediately follows if $d(n + 1) > d(k)$ for all $k \leq n$.
Thus, to solve part 1, it suffices to show that there exists infinitely many $n \geq 1$ with such property.
This follows since the divisor function $d$ is unbounded.

\item
This time, $f(n + 1) < f(n) \iff d(n + 1) < f(n) \iff n d(n + 1) < g(n)$.
The inequality follows if $n + 1$ is prime and $g(n) > 2n$.
Clearly, there exists infinitely many primes.
So, it suffices to prove that $g(n) > 2n$ for $n$ big enough.
As $d(n) \geq 2$ for all $n \geq 2$, it suffices to check that $g(6) > 12$.
Indeed, $g(6) = 14$.

\end{enumerate}
