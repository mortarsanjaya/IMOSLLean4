Let $f : \N \to \Z$ be a non-constant function such that $a - b \mid f(a) - f(b)$ for any $a, b \in \N$.
Prove that there exists infinitely many primes $p$ that divide $f(c)$ for some $c \in \N$.



\subsection*{Solution}

Official solution: \url{https://www.imo-official.org/problems/IMO2009SL.pdf}

We follow Solution 1 of the official solution in a simplified manner.
We go via contradiction; assuming that only finitely many primes divide a value of $f$, we show that $f$ is constant.

First, we reduce to showing that infinitely many $k \in \N$ such that $f(k) = f(0)$.
Indeed, suppose that this hypothesis holds, and fix some $b \in \N$.
We can choose $k$ very large such that $k > b + |f(0) - f(b)|$ and $f(k) = f(0)$.
Since $k - b$ divides and is greater than $|f(k) - f(b)| = |f(0) - f(b)|$, we get $f(b) = f(0)$, as desired.

We show something stronger than the remaining goal.
Letting $N = 4K! \cdot |f(0)|$, we show that in fact $f(kN) = f(0)$ for all $k \in \N$.
Clearly, as long as $N > 0$, this yields that infinitely many $k \in \N$ satisfies $f(k) = f(0)$.
Note that indeed $N > 0$ since $f(0) \neq 0$; otherwise all primes would divide $f(0)$.

Fix a positive integer $k$.
We have $N \mid kN \mid f(kN) - f(0)$ for any positive integer $k$.
Since $f(0) \mid N$, we have $f(0) \mid f(kN)$.
Letting $M = \frac{f(kN)}{f(0)} \in \Z$, we get $4K! \mid M - 1$.

By the problem's initial condition, any prime greater than $K$ does not divide $M$.
On the other hand, the above divisibility also means that the primes $p \leq K$ does not divide $M$; they divide $M - 1$.
This forces $M = \pm 1$, and thus $M = 1$ since $4 \nmid -1 - 1$.
Thus, we get $f(kN) = M f(0) = f(0)$, as desired.
