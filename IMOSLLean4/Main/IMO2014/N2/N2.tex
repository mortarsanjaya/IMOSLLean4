Find all pairs $(x, y)$ of integers such that
\[ 7x^2 - 13xy + 7y^2 = (|x - y| + 1)^3. \]



\subsection*{Answer}

$(m^3 + 2m^2 - m - 1, m^3 + m^2 - 2m - 1)$ and its permutation for some integer $m$.



\subsection*{Solution}

Official solution: \url{https://www.imo-official.org/problems/IMO2014SL.pdf}

We follow the official solution, simplifying at some parts.
Note that we solve it more generally.
For convenience, denote $A(m) = m^3 + 2m^2 - m - 1$ and $B(m) = m^3 + m^2 - 2m - 1$.

Let $d = |x - y|$.
First, rewrite the original equation as
\[ 4(d + 1)^3 = 27(x - y)^2 + (x + y)^2 = 27d^2 + (x + y)^2 \iff (x + y)^2 = (d - 2)^2 (4d + 1). \tag{1}\label{2014n2-eq1} \]
It now suffices to solve~\eqref{2014n2-eq1} in terms of $d = |x - y|$ and $x + y$.

From the above equation, we see that $4d + 1$ must also be a square; or $d = 2$, for which $4d + 1 = 9$ is again a square.
This holds precisely when $d = m^2 + m$ for some integer $m$.
Substituting back into~\eqref{2014n2-eq1} gives
\[ (x + y)^2 = (m^2 + m - 2)^2 (2m + 1)^2 \iff x + y = \pm (m^2 + m - 2)(2m + 1). \]
WLOG we can assume that $d \geq 0$.
If the sign is positive, solving yields $(x, y) = (A(m), B(m))$ .
If the sign is negative, solving yields $(x, y) = (A(-m - 1), B(-m - 1))$.
Finally, by backtracking, we see that $(A(m), B(m))$ satisfies~\eqref{2014n2-eq1} for any integer $m$.
