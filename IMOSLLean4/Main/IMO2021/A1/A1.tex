Let $n$ be an integer and $A$ be a subset of $\{0, 1, \ldots, 5^n\}$ of size $4n + 2$.
Prove that there exists $a, b, c \in A$ such that $a < b < c$ and $c + 2a > 3b$.



\subsection*{Solution}

Official solution: \url{https://www.imo-official.org/problems/IMO2021SL.pdf}

We follow Solution 1 of the official solution.
More generally, let $x_0 < x_1 < \ldots < x_{N + 1}$ be non-negative integers such that $x_k + 2 x_i \leq 3 x_j$ for all $k > j > i$.
Then we prove that $x_{N + 1} \geq (3/2)^N$.
For the original problem, just take $N = 4n$ and choose the $x_i$s such that $A = \{x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_{N + 1}\}$.

We are given that $x_{N + 1} + 2 x_i \leq 3 x_{i + 1}$ for each $i < N$.
Rearranging gives $2 (x_{N + 1} - x_i) \geq 3 (x_{N + 1} - x_{i + 1})$.
Now it's immediate by induction on $i$ that $2^i (x_{N + 1} - x_0) \geq 3^i (x_{N + 1} - x_i)$ for all $i \leq N$.
In particular, we get the desired inequality:
\[ 2^N x_{N + 1} \geq 2^N (x_{N + 1} - x_0) \geq 3^N (x_{N + 1} - x_N) \geq 3^N. \]
