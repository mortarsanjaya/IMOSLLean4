Let $R$ be a totally ordered commutative ring.
Let $(x_n)_{n \geq 0}$ be a sequence of elements of $R$ such that, for each $n \in \N$,
\[ x_{n + 1} x_{n + 2} \geq x_n^2 + 1. \]
Show that for any $N \in \N$,
\[ 27 (x_0 + x_1 + \ldots + x_{N + 1})^2 > 8N^3. \tag{*}\label{2021a7-eq0} \]



\subsection*{Solution}

Official solution: \url{https://www.imo-official.org/problems/IMO2021SL.pdf}

We follow Solution 1 of the official solution.
However, we can't use the property of real numbers here.
The proof of the second lemma has to be changed.

\begin{lemma}\label{2021a7-1}
For any $a, b, c \in R$, we have $(a + 2b)^2 \geq (b + 2c)^2 + 6(ab - c^2)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
This follows since $(a + 2b)^2 = (a - b)^2 + 2(b - c)^2 + (b + 2c)^2 + 6(ab - c^2)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{2021a7-2}
Let $r \in R$ and $(y_n)_{n \geq 0}$ be a sequence of non-negative elements of $R$ such that $y_n^2 \geq nr$ for each $n$.
Then we have
\[ 9 (y_0 + y_1 + \ldots + y_N)^2 \geq 4N^3 r. \]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The case $r < 0$ is trivial, so assume that $r \geq 0$.
Induction on $N$, with the base case $N = 0$ trivial.
Now fix $N \geq 1$, let $s = y_0 + y_1 + \ldots + y_N$, and suppose that $9s^2 \geq 4N^3 r$.
Since $y_{N + 1}^2 \geq (N + 1)r$, we have
\[ (9 s y_{N + 1})^2 \geq 6^2 N^3 (N + 1) r^2 \implies (18 s y_{N + 1})^2 \geq 16 N(N + 1) \cdot (3Nr)^2. \]
We have $16 N(N + 1) \geq (4N + 1)^2$ if $N > 0$.
Thus, we always have $16 N(N + 1) \cdot (3Nr)^2 \geq ((4N + 1) \cdot 3Nr)^2$.
Since $4N^3 + 9(N + 1) + (4N + 1) \cdot 3N = 4(N + 1)^3 + 5$, this gives us the desired inequality.
\end{proof}

Now let $y_n = x_n + 2 x_{n + 1}$ for each $n \geq 0$.
By Lemma~\ref{2021a7-1}, we have $y_{n + 1}^2 \geq y_n^2 + 6$ for each $n \in \N$.
By induction, we get $y_n^2 \geq 6n$.
Lemma~\ref{2021a7-2} with $r = 6$ yields
\[ 9 (y_0 + y_1 + \ldots + y_N)^2 \geq 24 N^3 \iff 3 (y_0 + y_1 + \ldots + y_N)^2 \geq 8 N^3. \]
On the other hand,
\[ 3 (x_0 + x_1 + \ldots + x_{N + 1}) = y_0 + y_1 + \ldots + y_N + 2 x_0 + x_{N + 1} > y_0 + y_1 + \ldots + y_N. \]
Combining the two inequalities yield~\eqref{2021a7-eq0}.



\subsection*{Extra notes}

It is possible to prove that the best lower bound is $\left(\frac{2n}{3}\right)^{3/2} + O(\sqrt{n} \log n)$.
Taking $x_k = \sqrt{2k/3} + c \ln (k + 1)/\sqrt{k + 1}$ should work for some small constant $c$.
Is it possible to improve the error term in the lower bound, say to $O(\sqrt{n})$?
