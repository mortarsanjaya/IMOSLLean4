An integer $n$ is called \emph{cubefree} if $p^3 \nmid n$ for any prime $p$.
Find all triplets of positive integers $(a, b, n)$ such that $a^2 + b + 3$ is cube-free and
\[ ab + 3b + 8 = n(a^2 + b + 3). \tag{*}\label{2021n1-eq0} \]



\subsection*{Answer}

$(k + 1, 2k, 2)$, where $k$ is a positive integer such that $k + 2$ is squarefree.



\subsection*{Solution}

Official solution: \url{https://www.imo-official.org/problems/IMO2021SL.pdf}

We follow the official solution.
The original question only asks for $n$ such that the condition is satisfied for some $(a, b)$.
However, finding $(a, b)$ is immediate afterwards.

The equality~\eqref{2021n1-eq0} implies
\[ (a + 3)(a^2 + b + 3) = (a + 1)^3 + (ab + 3b + 8) = (a + 1)^3 + n(a^2 + b + 3). \]
In particular, $a^2 + b + 3$ divides $(a + 1)^3$.
Since $a^2 + b + 3$ is cubefree, it divides $(a + 1)^2$.
On the other hand, $(a + 1)^2 < 2(a^2 + b + 3)$, so we have
\[ (a + 1)^2 = a^2 + b + 3 \iff b + 2 = 2a. \]
Plugging back into the previous equality yields $n = 2$.
Since $a$ and $b$ are positive, this yields $a = k + 1$ and $b = 2k$ for some $k \in \N^+$.
The only remaining condition to check is that $a^2 + b + 3 = (k + 2)^2$ is cubefree, which is equivalent to $k + 2$ being squarefree.
