Consider a complete graph with an infinite vertex set $V$.
Each edge $xy$ is coloured such that for each vertex $v$, there exists only finitely many colours assigned to an edge incident with $v$.
Prove that if some of the edges has distinct colours, then there exists $x, y, z \in V$, pairwise distinct, such that $c_{xy} = c_{xz} \neq c_{yz}$.


\subsection*{Solution}

We prove the contrapositive.
Assume that $c_{xy} = c_{xz}$ implies $c_{xy} = c_{xz} = c_{yz}$.
Then we claim that the graph is monochromatic.

Fix a vertex $v_0 \in V$.
By pigeonhole principle, there exists a colour $c$ such that the set $X = \{v \in V : c_{v_0 v} = c\}$ is infinite.
We claim that $c_{xy} = c$ for any $x \neq y \in V$.
By our assumption, it suffices to show that $c_{v_0 v} = c$ for all $v \in V$.

Indeed, fix a vertex $v$.
By pigeonhole principle, there exists $w_1 \neq w_2 \in X$ such that $c_{vw_1} = c_{vw_2}$.
Then $c_{v_0 w_1} = c_{v_0 w_2} = c_{w_1 w_2} = c = c_{v_0 w_1} = c_{v_0 w_2}$.
In particular, $c_{v_0 w_1} = c_{v_0 w_1} = c$, which forces $c_{v_0 v} = c$, as desired.
