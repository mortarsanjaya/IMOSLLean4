Determine all integers $m > 1$ such that $n \mid \binom{n}{m - 2n}$ for every $n \in \N$ with $n \leq m/2$.



\subsection*{Answer}

Prime numbers.



\subsection*{Solution}

Official solution: \url{https://www.imo-official.org/problems/IMO2012SL.pdf}

The following solution we present is the official solution.
We consider three cases.

\begin{itemize}

\item
$m$ is even and composite.

We can write $m = 2k$ for some $k > 1$.
Then plugging $n = k$ yields a contradiction.

\item
$m$ is odd and composite.

Then we can write $m = p(2k + 1)$ for some $p, k \in \N$, where $p$ is prime and $k > 0$.
We claim that $n = pk$ does not work, i.e., $pk \nmid \binom{pk}{p}$.
Indeed, we can write
\[ \binom{pk}{p} = k \cdot \frac{(pk - 1)(pk - 2) \ldots (p(k - 1) + 1)}{(p - 1)!}. \]
But the second factor is not divisible by $p$.

\item
$m$ is prime.

Fix $n \leq m/2$, and write $m = 2n + c$ for some $c \in \N$.
If $n = 0$, then $\binom{0}{c} = 0$ since $c = m$ is prime, thus positive.
If $n > 0$ and $c = 0$, then $m = 2n$ is prime, so $n = 1$.
It remains to consider the case $n, c > 0$.

Now, $2n$ and $c$ are positive numbers whose sum is a prime.
Then $n$ and $c$ are coprime.
Thus, $n \mid \binom{n}{c}$ follows from
\[ n \mid n \binom{n - 1}{c - 1} = c \binom{n}{c}. \]

\end{itemize}



\subsection*{Extra notes}

The original problem has a more restricted inequality, $m/3 \leq n \leq m/2$.
We remove the inequality $m/3 \leq n$ since the only thing that this inequality does is making sure that $\binom{n}{m - 2n}$ is a positive integer.
Note that, by convention, we define $\binom{a}{b} = 0$ if $0 \leq a < b$, and also we define $0 \mid 0$.
