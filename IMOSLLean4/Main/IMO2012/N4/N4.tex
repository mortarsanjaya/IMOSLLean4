An integer $a$ is called \emph{friendly} if there exists $m, n \in \N^+$ such that
\[ (m^2 + n)(n^2 + m) = a(m - n)^3. \tag{*}\label{2012n4-eq0} \]

\begin{enumerate}
    \item   Prove that $\{1, 2, \ldots, 2012\}$ contains at least $500$ friendly integers.
    \item   Is $2$ friendly?
\end{enumerate}



\subsection*{Answer for part 2}

No.



\subsection*{Solution}

Official solution: \url{https://www.imo-official.org/problems/IMO2012SL.pdf}

The solution presented here is a copy of the official solution.

\begin{enumerate}

    \item 
    More generally, any integer of form $4k + 1$ for some positive integer $k$ is good.
    Indeed, take $m = 2k + 1$ and $n = k$ in~\eqref{2012n4-eq0}.
    The set $\{1, 2, \ldots, 2012\}$ contains $502 > 500$ integers of this form.

    \item
    Suppose for the sake of contradiction that $2$ is friendly.
    Consider~\eqref{2012n4-eq0} with $a = 2$.
    Clearly, $m > n$, as the LHS is positive.
    Rearranging using difference of squares give
    \[ (m^2 + n + n^2 + m)^2 - (m^2 + n - n^2 - m)^2 = 8(m - n)^3, \]
    \[ (m^2 + n + n^2 + m)^2 = (m - n)^2 (8(m - n) + (m + n - 1)^2). \]
    Thus, $8(m - n) + (m + n - 1)^2$ must be a perfect square.
    By parity reason, there exists $s \in \N^+$ such that
    \[ 8(m - n) + (m + n - 1)^2 = (m + n - 1 + 2s)^2 \iff 2(m - n) = s(m + n - 1 + s). \]
    Since $0 < m - n < m + n - 1$, the latter forces $s = 1$.
    Then $m = 3n$, and plugging back into~\eqref{2012n4-eq0} yields $(9n^2 + n)(3n^2 + 3n) = 16n^3$.
    However, $(9n^2 + n)(3n^2 + 3n) \geq 27n^3 > 16n^3$ since $n > 0$; a contradiction.

\end{enumerate}
