Let $R$ be a commutative ring.
A set $A \subseteq R$ is called admissible if for any $x, y \in A$ and $r \in R$, we have $x^2 + rxy + y^2 \in A$.
Determine all pairs $(x, y) \in R^2$ such that the only admissible set containing $x$ and $y$ is $R$.



\subsection*{Answer}

They are precisely the pairs $(x, y)$ such that $x$ and $y$ are coprime, i.e., $rx + sy = 1$ for some $r, s \in R$.



\subsection*{Solution}

Official solution: \url{https://www.imo-official.org/problems/IMO2012SL.pdf}

The following solution is a slight modification from the official solution.
Note that it still works over any commutative ring.

First, suppose that the pair $(x, y)$ satisfies the requirement.
Take $A = \langle x, y \rangle$, the ideal generated by $x$ and $y$.
It is easy to check that $A$ is admissible, so $A = R$.
This necessarily implies that $x$ and $y$ are coprime.

Conversely, suppose that $x$ and $y$ are coprime.
Let $A$ be an admissible set containing $x$ and $y$.
First, for any $z \in A$ and $r \in R$, we have $rz^2 = z^2 + (r - 2) z^2 + z^2 \in A$.
In particular, it suffices to show that $1 \in A$, as plugging $z = 1$ then yields $A = R$.

Now, since $x$ and $y$ are coprime, so are $x^2$ and $y^2$.
Thus we have $ax^2 + by^2 = 1$ for some $a, b \in R$.
By the previous argument, $ax^2, by^2 \in A$.
This gives us $1 = (ax^2)^2 + 2(ax^2)(by^2) + (by^2)^2 \in A$, as desired.
