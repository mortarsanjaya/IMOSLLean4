Let $\alpha$ be a totally ordered type.
Given two functions $f, g : \alpha \to \alpha$, we say that $f \leq g$ (resp. $f < g$) iff $f(x) \leq g(x)$ (resp. $f(x) < g(x)$) for any $x \in \alpha$.

A Spanish couple on $\alpha$ is a pair of strictly increasing functions $(f, g)$ from $\alpha$ to itself such that $f \circ g \circ g < g \circ f$.
Determine whether there exists a Spanish couple on 1. $\N$; and 2. $\N \times \N$ with the lexicographical order.
By lexicographical order, we mean that $(a, b) \leq (c, d)$ iff either $a < c$, or $a = c$ and $b \leq d$.



\subsection*{Answer}

NO for part 1 and YES for part 2.



\subsection*{Solution}

Official solution: \url{http://www.imo-official.org/problems/IMO2008SL.pdf}

We present the official solution.
In fact, we will generalize part 2, as we see in this solution.

\begin{enumerate}

    \item
    Suppose that $\alpha = \N$ and that a Spanish couple $(f, g)$ exists.
    By the property of $\N$, we have $f, g \geq \id_{\N}$.
    Furthermore, we have $g < f$, since $g \circ f > f \circ g \circ g \geq g \circ g$.
    In particular, we actually have $\id_{\N} < f$.
    We now prove by induction on $k$ that $g^k \leq f$ for all $k \geq 0$.

    The base case $k = 0$ has been done, so now suppose that $g^k < f$ for some $k \geq 0$.
    Then, by the second property of the Spanish couple, we have $g^{k + 2} < f \circ g \circ g < g \circ f$.
    Since $g$ is strictly increasing, this implies $g^{k + 1} < f$.

    If $g = \id$, then $f \circ g \circ g = g \circ f = f$; a contradiction.
    Thus there exists $x \in \N$ such that $g(x) > x$.
    But then the sequence $(g^k(x))_{k \geq 0}$ is strictly increasing and bounded above by $f(x)$; a contradiction.
    Thus, there exists no Spanish couple for $\alpha = \N$.

    
    
    \item
    The generalization is as follows.
    Let $\beta$ be a totally ordered type.
    Suppose that a function $\phi : \beta \to \beta$ is strictly increasing and satisfies $\phi(x) > x$ for all $x \in \beta$.
    Then we construct a Spanish couple on $\N \times \beta$ using $\phi$.
    In particular, we get the answer we want for the original problem with $\beta = \N$ and $\phi : n \mapsto n + 1$.
    
    Let $\alpha = \N \times \beta$.
    Define $f, g : \alpha \to \alpha$ by $f(n, x) = (n + 1, x)$ and $g(n, x) = (n, \phi^{3^n}(x))$.
    It is easy to show that $f$ and $g$ are strictly increasing.
    Now, for any $n \in \N$ and $x \in \beta$, since $2 \cdot 3^n < 3^{n + 1}$, we get
    \[ f(g(g(n, x))) = (n + 1, \phi^{2 \cdot 3^n}(x)) < (n + 1, \phi^{3^{n + 1}}(x)) = g(f(x)). \]



\end{enumerate}
