Given $n \in \N$ such that $2^n + 65 \mid 5^n - 3^n$, prove that $n = 0$.

We present a rather quick Solution 2 of the official solution.
We can even afford to generalize $65$ to any number congruent to $5$ modulo $60$.
Here, fix any positive integer $N \equiv 5 \pmod{60}$.

Clearly, $n = 1$ does not work as $N + 2 > 2 = 5 - 3$.
If $n > 0$ is even, then $3$ divides $2^n + N$ but not $5^n - 3^n$.
It remains to consider the case where $n > 1$ and $n$ is odd.

In this case, using quadratic reciprocity gives
\[ \left(\frac{2^n + N}{5}\right) = \left(\frac{5}{2^n + N}\right) = \left(\frac{5^n}{2^n + N}\right) = \left(\frac{3^n}{2^n + N}\right) = \left(\frac{3}{2^n + N}\right). \]
By quadratic reciprocity, Jacobi symbol version,
\[ \left(\frac{2^n + N}{5}\right) = \left(\frac{2^n + N}{3}\right). \]
Since $5 \mid N$, the left hand side equals $\left(\frac{2}{5}\right) = -1$.
On the other hand, $2^n \equiv N \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$, so the right hand side equals $\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 1$.
Contradiction.
