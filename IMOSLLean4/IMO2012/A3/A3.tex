Let $R$ be a totally ordered commutative ring and $x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_n \in R$ (with $n \geq 1$) be positive elements such that $x_0 x_1 \ldots x_n = 1$.
Prove that \[ (1 + x_0)^2 (1 + x_1)^3 \ldots (1 + x_n)^{n + 2} > (n + 2)^{n + 2}. \]



\subsection*{Solution}

Official solution: \url{https://www.imo-official.org/problems/IMO2012SL.pdf}

We follow the official solution, but we avoid the given substitution.

By Bernoulli's inequality, for any $n \in \N$ and $x, y \in R$ with $x > 0$ and $x + y > 0$,
\[ (x + y)^{n + 1} \geq x^n (x + (n + 1) y), \]
    with equality iff $n = 0$ or $y = 0$.
Now replace $x$ with $n + 1$ and $y$ with $ny - 1$.
We get that for all $n > 0$ and $y > -1$,
\[ (n + ny)^{n + 1} \geq (n + 1)^n \cdot (n + 1) ny \iff n^n (1 + y)^{n + 1} \geq (n + 1)^{n + 1} y, \]
    with equality iff $ny = 1$.
Applying this inequality $n + 1$ times yield
\[ \prod_{k = 0}^n (1 + x_k)^{k + 2} \geq (n + 2)^{n + 2} x_0 x_1 \ldots x_n, \]
    with equality iff $(k + 1) x_k = 1$ for each $k \leq n$.
Clearly, this can't happen if $x_0 x_1 \ldots x_n = 1$.
The strict inequality is the desired inequality; we are done.
