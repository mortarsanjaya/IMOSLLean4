# IMO 2012 A7

Given a distributing lattice $α$, the *inf-closure* (resp. *sup-closure*) of a subset
  $S ⊆ α$ is the smallest set containing $S$ that is closed under infimum (resp. supremum).
The *meta-closure* of $S$ is the sup-closure of the inf-closure of $S$.

Let $R$ be a totally ordered commutative ring and $σ$ be a set.
Let $R[σ]$ denote the ring of multivariate polynomials with variable set $σ$.
Let $S$ denote the meta-closure of $R[σ]$ as a subset of $R^σ → R$.
Prove that $S$ is a subring of $R^σ → R$.

### Notes

The original formulation only asks to prove that $S$ is closed under multiplication.
However, the official solution essentially proves that $S$ is a ring.
